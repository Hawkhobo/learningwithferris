## [Doing exercises](#doing-exercises){.text-white .no-underline .transition-none .hover:underline}

The exercises are sorted by topic and can be found in the subdirectory
`exercises/<topic>`. For every topic, there is an additional `README.md`
file with some resources to get you started on the topic. We highly
recommend that you have a look at them before you start 📚️

Most exercises contain an error that keeps them from compiling, and
it\'s up to you to fix it! Some exercises contain tests that need to
pass for the exercise to be done ✅

Search for `TODO` and `todo!()` to find out what you need to change. Ask
for hints by entering `h` in the *watch mode* 💡

## [Watch Mode](#watch-mode){.text-white .no-underline .transition-none .hover:underline}

After the
[initialization](https://rustlings.rust-lang.org/setup/#initialization),
Rustlings can be launched by simply running the command `rustlings`.

This will start the *watch mode* which walks you through the exercises
in a predefined order (what we think is best for newcomers). It will
rerun the current exercise automatically every time you change the
exercise\'s file in the `exercises/` directory.

**If detecting file changes in the `exercises/` directory fails...**
(*click to expand*)

> You can add the **`--manual-run`** flag (`rustlings --manual-run`) to
> manually rerun the current exercise by entering `r` in the watch mode.
>
> Please [report the
> issue](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings/issues/new) with some
> information about your operating system and whether you run Rustlings
> in a container or a virtual machine (e.g. WSL).

## [Exercise List](#exercise-list){.text-white .no-underline .transition-none .hover:underline}

In the [watch mode](https://rustlings.rust-lang.org/usage/#watch-mode)
(after launching `rustlings`), you can enter `l` to open the interactive
exercise list.

The list allows you to...

-   See the status of all exercises (done or pending)
-   `c`: Continue at another exercise (temporarily skip some exercises
    or go back to a previous one)
-   `r`: Reset status and file of the selected exercise (you need to
    *reload/reopen* its file in your editor afterwards)

See the footer of the list for all possible keys.

## [Questions?](#questions){.text-white .no-underline .transition-none .hover:underline}

If you need any help while doing the exercises and the builtin hints
aren\'t helpful, feel free to ask in the [*Q&A*
discussions](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings/discussions/categories/q-a?discussions_q=)
if your question isn\'t answered there 💡

## [Continuing On](#continuing-on){.text-white .no-underline .transition-none .hover:underline}

Once you\'ve completed Rustlings, put your new knowledge to good use!
Continue practicing your Rust skills by building your own projects,
contributing to Rustlings, or finding other open-source projects to
contribute to.
